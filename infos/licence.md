# Kaisen Linux licence

## Forked packages
Forked packages keep the same license as the original packages. Only the maintainer's name is changed because it is out of the original Debian branch.  

## Kaisen Linux packages
All Kaisen Linux packages are provided under the AGPL license. This license was chosen to reinforce the community spirit of Kaisen Linux, the AGPL license obliges us to transfer to the software developer the modifications made to the source code. This improves Kaisen Linux and thus finds possible contributors to help us.
