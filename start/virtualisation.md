# Virtualisation

In a nutshell, here's how to virtualize Kaisen Linux.  
We assume here that you know what a hypervisor is, as well as creating a virtual machine.  
We recommends use VirtualBox or VMWare Workstation.  
The VMWare guests daemon as activated by default when Kaisen Linux is executed with VMWare Workstation.  

##Â VirtualBox

You can virtualize Kaisen Linux with VirtualBox hypervisor.  
Following this step:

### Minimal Configuration

```bash
1)  New virtual machine
2)  Name: Your choice
3)  Folder: Your choice
4)  Type: Linux
5)  System: Debian 10 (64 bits)
6)  RAM: 1Go
7)  Create Virtual Disk
8)  Disk type : VDI (or VMDK)
9)  Dynamic allocated
10) Hard Drive: 10Go
11) Click at : Configuration => Network => Adapter1
12) Network configuration: NAT, Bridge, Host-only, NAT network, or not (the installer not using network and all tools are included) (optional parameter)
13) System => Processor => CPU: 1 core
14) You can use EFI (optional parameter)
15) Leave the other default settings (except if you have specific needs)
```

Then start your virtual machine on the ISO.
After starting the virtual machine, via the menu:

```bash
Kaisen Linux => Services => Virtualization => virtualbox-guest-enable
```

### Recommend configuration

```bash
1)  New virtual machine
2)  Name: Your choice
3)  Folder: Your choice
4)  Type: Linux
5)  System: Debian 10 (64 bits)
6)  RAM: 4Go
7)  Create Virtual Disk
8)  Disk type : VDI (or VMDK)
9)  Dynamic allocated
10) Hard Drive: 30Go
11) Click at : Configuration => Network => Adapter1
12) Network configuration: NAT, Bridge, Host-only, NAT network, or not (the installer not using network and all tools are included) (optional parameter)
13) System => Processor => CPU: 2 core
14) You can use EFI (optional parameter)
15) Leave the other default settings (except if you have specific needs)
```

Then start your virtual machine on the ISO.
After starting the virtual machine, via the menu:

```bash
Kaisen Linux => Services => Virtualization => virtualbox-guest-enable
```

## VMWare Workstation

You can virtualize Kaisen Linux with VMWare Workstation hypervisor.
Following this step:

### Minimal configuration

```bash
1)  New Vitual Machine
2)  Typical
3)  Use ISO image (select your ISO with browse button)
4)  Guest Operating System: Debian 10 64 bits
5)  Name: Your choice
6)  Location: Your choice
7)  Disk Size: 10Go
8)  Select: "Store virtual disk as a single file"
9)  Select: "Customize hardware"
10) RAM: 1Go
11) CPU: 1 core and 1 CPU
12) Network: NAT, Bridge, LAN segment, Host-Only or not (the installer not using network and all tools are included) (optional parameter)
13) Leave the other default settings (except if you have specific needs)
14) Click in: Finish
15) For activate UEFI: Shutdown VM and click at => "Edit virtual machine settings" => Options => Advanced => UEFI
```

Then start your virtual machine on the ISO.
After starting the virtual machine, via the menu:

```bash
Kaisen Linux => Services => Virtualization => vmware-guest-enable
```

### Recommend configuration

```bash
1)  New Vitual Machine
2)  Typical
3)  Use ISO image (select your ISO with browse button)
4)  Guest Operating System: Debian 10 64 bits
5)  Name: Your choice
6)  Location: Your choice
7)  Disk Size: 30Go
8)  Select: "Store virtual disk as a single file"
9)  Select: "Customize hardware"
10) RAM: 4Go
11) CPU: 2 core and 1 CPU
12) Network: NAT, Bridge, LAN segment, Host-Only or not (the installer not using network and all tools are included) (optional parameter)
13) Leave the other default settings (except if you have specific needs)
14) Click in: Finish
15) For activate UEFI: Shutdown VM and click at => "Edit virtual machine settings" => Options => Advanced => UEFI
```

Then start your virtual machine on the ISO.
After starting the virtual machine, via the menu:

```bash
Kaisen Linux => Services => Virtualization => vmware-guest-enable
```

## Informations for QEMU/KVM

### Tools and daemons

To facilitate the creation of a virtualized virtual machine with QEMU/KVM, all virtual machines can be created through virt-manager. Full support for different agents like QEMU agent, SPICE, are integrated by default but disabled.  
SPICE agents allow you to activate the shared clipboard, put the virtual machine in full screen when viewing it via the console. This is the equivalent of the virtualbox and vmware agents.  
SPICE agents are managed by a systemd service.  
The integrated services are named **spice-vdagent** as well as **spice-webdavd**.
The **spice-vdagent** daemon allows you to enable copy and paste as well as to adjust the resolution of the virtual machine screen in relation to the resolution of the host. This daemon is useful for guest guests (using a graphical interface).  
The **spice-webdavd** daemon is used to support file sharing between the host and the virtual machine.  

### Daemons gestion

The spice-webdavd daemon can be easily enabled and disabled here:

```bash
Kaisen Linux => Services => Virtualization => spice-webdavd-enable
Kaisen Linux => Services => Virtualization => spice-webdavd-disable
```

The spice-vdagent daemon can be easily enabled and disabled here:

```bash
Kaisen Linux => Services => Virtualization => spice-vdagent-enable
Kaisen Linux => Services => Virtualization => spice-vdagent-disable
```

**Warning:**
After the activation of the spice-vdagent daemon on your virtual machine, you need to make the SPICE window full screen and manually run the "spice-vdagent" command and then disconnect your graphical session to make the virtual machine fully full screen.
