It is therefore a category purely focused on the administration of Windows and Linux systems. Tools like Ansible, Docker, parallel-ssh, rsync, zsync to name a few are classified into this category and subcategories.

start/hardware.md:Kaisen Linux is 100% compatible with computers with a classic BIOS called LEGACY and a UEFI BIOS. The UEFI BIOS is different and more recent than its predecessor and allows disk support for more than 2TB and 255 primary partitions (unlike the LEGACY BIOS which only supported 4 maximum). If your computer is less than 10 years old, you have a 99% chance of having a UEFI BIOS.

os/How-to-build-custom-ISO.md:Version 1.0 is an example, but you can put whatever you want, I advise you not to put too many letters and numbers because if the name of the ISO volume exceeds 32 characters, the compilation will crash. The name of the ISO volume is "Kaisen Linux Rolling $variant $version" ($variant corresponds here to CUSTOM and $version corresponds here to 1.0), in the example, the name of the ISO volume will be Kaisen Linux Rolling CUSTOM 1.0.
os/How-to-change-graphical-interface.md:The script since Kaisen Linux revision 1.4 is designed when the script starts up (after all checks have been made), to update itself if a new, more recent version of the script (installed by the kaisen-kde package, kaisen-lxde, kaisen-mate, kaisen-xfce depending on your current GUI). This is intended if you do not update often, to be able to change your interface and update the list of packages to uninstall. The main purpose of this is to automate the task even more, saving you time.
